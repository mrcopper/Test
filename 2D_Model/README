README FILE
The script 'do' compiles the program, runs the executable, and plots the results. The program output is stored in 'runlog'. The 'profile' script produces a call tree with valgrind and opens it with kcachegrind. These are open source programs available in the ubuntu standard repositories. The program can be controlled through the 'input.dat' file. To compile the program without running, simply call 'make'.
